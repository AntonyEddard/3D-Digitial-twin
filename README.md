# 3D-Digitial-twin
tyring out gaussians 
my application on 3D digital twin is for construction and architectural application 
Although there are many lidar based methods, video to 3d models are much more cheaper and easy to create for a common man
so i have created this repo for video input based 3d reconstruction pipeline
